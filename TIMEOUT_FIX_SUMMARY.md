# EasyPaisa Timeout Fix - Summary

## 🔍 Root Cause Identified

**Hostinger Shared Hosting Limitation:**
- ❌ Laravel's `Http` facade (Guzzle) has a **hard 10-second timeout limit**
- ✅ Raw PHP cURL can use up to **120-180 seconds**
- 💡 Solution: Replace `Http::timeout()` with raw cURL

## ✅ Files Updated

### 1. **StatusService.php** ✅
**Changed from:**
```php
$response = Http::timeout(120)->post(...);
```

**Changed to:**
```php
$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 120);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 180);
// ... raw cURL implementation
```

### 2. **Easypaisa.php (Package)** ✅
**Changed from:**
```php
$response = Http::timeout(120)->post(...);
```

**Changed to:**
```php
$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 120);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 180);
// ... raw cURL implementation
```

### 3. **TestEasypaisaController.php** ✅
Already uses raw cURL - no changes needed

## ⚙️ Timeout Settings Applied

- **Connection Timeout:** 120 seconds
- **Total Request Timeout:** 180 seconds (3 minutes)
- **Method:** Raw PHP cURL (bypasses Hostinger's Http limit)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Issue Still Exists:**
Even with 120-180 second timeouts, the connection to EasyPaisa is timing out. This means:

1. ✅ **Code is fixed** - Using raw cURL instead of Http facade
2. ❌ **Network issue remains** - Server cannot reach EasyPaisa API

### **Possible Causes:**
- EasyPaisa server is slow/unresponsive
- Network routing issues to Pakistan
- Firewall blocking specific endpoints
- EasyPaisa API is down/maintenance

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Endpoint:
```bash
curl "https://khushiconnect.com/api/simple-curl-test?orderId=test-001&phone=03316215445&amount=10"
```

### Check Logs:
```bash
# Check payin log
tail -f storage/logs/payin-*.log

# Check Laravel log  
tail -f storage/logs/laravel-*.log
```

## 📊 What Changed vs What Didn't

| Item | Before | After | Status |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| StatusService timeout | 10s (Http) | 180s (cURL) | ✅ Fixed |
| Easypaisa package timeout | 10s (Http) | 180s (cURL) | ✅ Fixed |
| Test controller timeout | 120s (cURL) | 120s (cURL) | ✅ Already good |
| Network connectivity | ❌ Failing | ❌ Still failing | ⚠️ Needs investigation |

## 🎯 Next Steps

### If Still Timing Out:

1. **Contact EasyPaisa Support**
   - Check if their API is experiencing issues
   - Verify your credentials are active
   - Ask about typical response times

2. **Network Diagnostics**
   - Test from different network/server
   - Check if EasyPaisa is blocking your server IP
   - Verify DNS resolution

3. **Alternative Solutions**
   - External proxy server (recommended)
   - VPS migration
   - Queue-based processing

## 📝 Files Modified

1. ✅ `app/Service/StatusService.php` - Updated easypaisa() method
2. ✅ `vendor/zfhassaan/easypaisa/src/Easypaisa.php` - Updated sendRequest() method
3. ℹ️ `app/Http/Controllers/Api/TestEasypaisaController.php` - Already using cURL

## ⚠️ Vendor File Warning

**Important:** The file `vendor/zfhassaan/easypaisa/src/Easypaisa.php` is in the vendor directory.

**This means:**
- ❌ Changes will be lost if you run `composer update`
- ✅ Solution: Create a custom extended class or request package author to update

### To Make Permanent:

**Option 1: Extend the class**
```php
namespace App\Services;

class CustomEasypaisa extends \Zfhassaan\Easypaisa\Easypaisa
{
    // Override sendRequest with cURL version
}
```

**Option 2: Fork the package**
- Fork the package on GitHub
- Make changes
- Use your fork in composer.json

**Option 3: Contact package author**
- Request timeout configuration option
- Submit pull request with cURL implementation

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

When deploying to production:
1. ✅ Code changes are applied
2. ⚠️ Monitor logs for timeout errors
3. ⚠️ Vendor changes need to be reapplied after composer update
4. ✅ Consider creating custom service class to avoid vendor modifications
